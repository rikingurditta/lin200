# Language Acquisition

## Stages of language acquisition

### Babbling

- starts around 4 to 8 months
- some speech sounds are more common in babbling than others
  - p, b, m, t, d, n, k, d, s, h, w, j
  - based on data from 15 languages

Order of acquisition:

- vowels are usually acquired before consonants
- among consonants, stops are usually acquired before other ones
- labials are acquired first, then alveolars, then velars
- interdentals are acquired last

### Holophrastic stage

Comprehension:

- children can comprehend much more than they can speak
- children who produce one/two word sentences can correctly interpret sentences such as "Cookie Monster is tickling Big Bird"

### Two word stage

- starts around 1.5 to 2 years
- children can produce sentences of two words

### Telegraphic stage

- starts around 2 to 2.5 years
- children start to produce more complex sentences, but lack morphemes that encode grammatical information
- e.g. "chair broken"
- emergence of phrase structure

## Vocabulary development

- 18 month old children have about 50 words in their vocabulary
- children tend to overgeneralize grammatical rules that they learn
  - e.g. when they learn to pluralize words by adding "s" to the end, they apply it in places where it is not grammatical, e.g. "mans"

## What makes language acquisition possible?

- children are born with prior knowledge of the grammar of any human language (universal grammar)
- language development is only possible with exposure to a language

### Critical period hypothesis

- the critical period hypothesis postulates that children need to be exposed to a language at a particular time in order to acquire it as their first language
- open question (?)
