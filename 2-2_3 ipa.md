# The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

## International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

- speech sounds of a language are called **phones**
- has a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and all known phones
  - this is not the case for English alphabet
- phonetic transcriptions are written in square brackets []

## Consonants

### Places of articulation

**Places of articulation** are the areas were there articulators create the most constriction

- Bilabial sounds: both lips are place of articulation
  - [p] in "**p**od"
  - [b] in "**b**lock"
  - [m] in "**m**op"
- Labiodental sounds: lips and teeth are place of articulation
  - [f] in "**f**un"
  - [v] in ""**v**ery"
- Interdental sounds: tongue and teeth are place of articulation
  - [θ] in "**th**roat"
  - [ð] in "**th**is"
- Etc

### Manner of articulation

**Nasal sounds** are when air goes through the nasal cavity, for example

- [m] in "su**m**"
- [n] in "su**n**"
- [ŋ] in "su**ng**"

**Stops** are when there is a complete closure either in the oral cavity or at the glottis, for example

- [p] in "s**p**an" is a bilabial stop
- the pause in "uh oh" is a glottal stop

**Fricatives** are when continuous airflow through a narrow opening causes friction, for example

- [s] in **s**ells
- [ʃ] in **sh**ells

**Affricates** are stops that are released slowly, for example

- [tʃ] in **ch**urch
- [dʒ] in **j**ump

### Voicing

**Voiced sounds** are ones where the vocal chords are vibrating, otherwise sounds are **voiceless**. For voiceless sounds, air passes through the glottis without much interference, e.g. [s].

## Vowels

Vowels differ from consonants because their air stream is unconstricted. They are distinguished by (tongue) height, (tongue) backness, (lip) rounding, and (tonge) tenseness.

### Height

A vowel's **height** is how how close the tongue is to the roof of the mouth when it is pronounced. There are 3 levels:

- *high*
  - e.g. [i] in "h**ea**t"
- *mid*
  - e.g. [e] in "h**a**te"
- low
  - e.g. [ɑ] in "h**o**t"

### Backness

A vowel's **backness** is whether the active part of the tongue is toward the front or back of the oral cavity. There are three levels:

- *back*
  - e.g. [u] in "h**oo**t"
- *central*
  - e.g. [ʌ] in "c**u**t"
- *front*
  - e.g. [ɪ] in "h**i**t"

### Rounding

A vowel's **rounding** is how rounded teh lips are when it is pronounced.

### Tenseness

A vowel's **tenseness** is how tense the tongue is when it is pronounced.

E.g. [i] is tenser than [ɪ]
