# Articulatory phonetics

## Phonetics

Can we infer the pronunciation of a word from its spelling?

Phonetics has three main fields:

- articulatory phonetics: which parts of our body are involved in speech production?
- acoustic phonetics: what are the properties of the sound waves produced during speech?
- auditory phonetics: what is involved in our perception of speech?

## Articulatory phonetics

Spoken languages are performed by manipulating parts of the vocal tract. These parts can be classified into:

- active articulators: the part that is moving in order to produce a sound
  - e.g. tongue
  - e.g. lower lip
- passive articulators: the part that the active articulator moves towards
  - e.g. upper lip
