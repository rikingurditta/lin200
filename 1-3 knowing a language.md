# What does it mean to know a language?

What is unconscious knowledge of language?

## Grammar and ambiguity

- We are not explicitly taught the different interpretations of sentences
- linguistic knowledge is not tuaght by our parents or teachers, we have unconscious knowledge of grammar
- regardless of where we were born, if we are exposed to a language we are able to acquire its grammar and have intuitions about it
  - e.g. an english speaker knows that "the dog at girl barked" is ungrammatical but "the dog barked at the girl" is grammatical

## Performance and competence

**Competence** is our intuitive knowledge of the rules that govern the languages we speak.

**Performance** is our actual use of the language.

- slips of the tongue are performance errors, not lack of competence
