# Sociolinguistics

## Speech communities

Differences in word choice, syntax, and pronunciation reveal that we are members of **speech communities**.

E.g. in European French 't' is pronounced with [t] while in Quebec French it is pronounced with [ts]

Language variation can depend on:

- geographic location
- time
- socio-economic status
- ethnicity
- gender
- context (style-shifting)

## Variables and variants

A feature of a language that is not constant among speakers (or within the speech of a single speaker) is called a **variable**. The different forms that a variable can take are called **variants**.

### Prestige

Some variants are associated with groups of higher status and hold (overt) **prestige**.

E.g. in New York, the inclusion of [r] after vowels is prestigious, and this can be heard in places that want to portray image of high class such as high fashion stores

### Covert prestige

Some variants hold **covert prestige**. These variants do not hold overt prestige, but speakers can use them to show that they are within a certain group, or to show solidarity with a certain group.
