# Pidgins, Creoles, and Code Switching

## Pidgins and creoles

A **pidgin** is a language being used for communication between people who do not speak the same language.

- limited in lexicon
- simplified structure
- most (if not all) have emerged due to colonization

They may evolve into a full-fledged language, called a **creole**. Creoles may be similar in vocabulary to the languages they are based on, but may have different structure.

For example, in Bahamian Creole, one might say "When he get the money he buy he girlfriend one present". Notice that verbs are not marked for tense.

## Code switching

**Code switching** is the use of two or more languages in the same interaction. Speakers switch entirely from one to another (in terms of phonological, grammatical, and lexical features).

Fluent bilingual speakers may code switch in order to achieve a communicative goal:

- emphasis
- disagreement
- convey nuances
- create social connection
