# Phonology

## Phonemes

**Phonemes** are sounds that differentiate meanings in a language.

### Minimal pairs

**Minimal pairs** are pairs of words that have different meanings and differ by one sound

- "pan" and "tan" differ by only /p/ vs /t/, so /p/ and /t/ are phonemes
- [iθɚ] (ether) and [iðɚ] (either) differ by only /θ/ vs /ð/

**Near minimal pairs** are pairs that differ by more than one sound, but are still used to show that sounds are phonemes

- "mission" and "vision" are a near minimal pair, because they differ by [m] and [v] and also [ʃ] and [ʒ]

## Allophones

A single phoneme can have different realizations based on context.

- /p/ is pronounced slightly differently in "pin" and "spin"
  - it is *aspirated* ([p^h^] in "spin") if it is at the beginning of a word and unaspirated ([p] in "pin") otherwise - they are in complementary distribution
  - other voiceless stops like /k/ and /t/ also have complementary aspirated/unaspirated allophones
  - in general, voiceless stops are aspirated at the beginning of a word or stressed syllable, and unaspirated elsewhere
    - an exception is, even if a syllable is stressed, a voiceless stop is unaspirated if it is preceded by [s], e.g. "store"
  - voiced stops are never aspirated
- /n/ has alveolar pronunciation ([n] as in "know") and dental pronunciation ([n̪] as in "month")
- /eɪ/ has long ([eɪ] as in "save") and short ([ĕɪ] as in "ache") allophones
  - these allophones are complementary, with the longer pronunciation happening before voiced consonants

Sounds that are allophones in one language could be phonemes in another! For example [t] and [t^h^] are allophones in English but phonemes in Hupa

## Phonological rules

- don't need to be taught formally
- are unconscious knowledge
- productive - can be applied to pronounce words never seen before
