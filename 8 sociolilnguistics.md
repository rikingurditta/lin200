# Sociolinguistics

## Speech communities

Differences in word choice, syntax, and pronunciation reveal that we are members of **speech communities**.

E.g. in European French 't' is pronounced with [t] while in Quebec French it is pronounced with [ts]

Language variation can depend on:

- geographic location
- time
- socio-economic status
- ethnicity
- gender
- context (style-shifting)

## Variables and variants

A feature of a language that is not constant among speakers (or within the speech of a single speaker) is called a **variable**. The different forms that a variable can take are called **variants**.

### Prestige

Some variants are associated with groups of higher status and hold (overt) **prestige**.

E.g. in New York, the inclusion of [r] after vowels is prestigious, and this can be heard in places that want to portray image of high class such as high fashion stores

### Covert prestige

Some variants hold **covert prestige**. These variants do not hold overt prestige, but speakers can use them to show that they are within a certain group, or to show solidarity with a certain group.

# Factors Impacting Language Variation

## Geographic location

**Phonetic and phonological variation**

An example of pronunciation difference across location is *Canadian raising*, which exists in Canadian English as well as in some other places. This is when the first part of the diphthong [aj] is pronounced higher, as [ÊŒ]

**Lexicon**

There are words used in North America which are used differently or not at all in other places. For example, North Americans say "gas" and "truck" when British people say "petrol" and "lorry".

**Morphological and syntactic variation**

While in standard English, we express the recent perfect tense in sentences like "I've just eaten", speakers of many dialects would say "I done ate", and Newfoundland English speakers might say "I'm after eating".

## Time

All languages change over time, but not abruptly.

For example, "whale" and "wail" used to be pronounced differently, but over time they have progressively changed to the same pronunciation.

## Ethnicity

### African American English

- not spoken by all African Americans
- not spoken by only African Americans
- has been mistaken for grammatical errors by speakers of other dialects

# Pidgins, Creoles, and Code Switching

## Pidgins and creoles

A **pidgin** is a language being used for communication between people who do not speak the same language.

- limited in lexicon
- simplified structure
- most (if not all) have emerged due to colonization

They may evolve into a full-fledged language, called a **creole**. Creoles may be similar in vocabulary to the languages they are based on, but may have different structure.

For example, in Bahamian Creole, one might say "When he get the money he buy he girlfriend one present". Notice that verbs are not marked for tense.

## Code switching

**Code switching** is the use of two or more languages in the same interaction. Speakers switch entirely from one to another (in terms of phonological, grammatical, and lexical features).

Fluent bilingual speakers may code switch in order to achieve a communicative goal:

- emphasis
- disagreement
- convey nuances
- create social connection
