# Semantics

**Semantics** is the study of the inherent meaning of words, constituents, sentences.

**Pragmatics** is the study of meaning that depends on/derives from the way in which the words/sentences are used.

## Semantic relations between words

**Synonyms** are words that have the same meaning in some contexts.

- "vacation" and "holidays" can mean the same thing in some contexts, but can differ in others - "holidays" can refer to vacations or regional holidays (e.g. christmas)

**Antonyms** are wordst hat are opposites with respect to some component of their meaning

**Polysemy** is when a word has two or more meanings

- "There is a *banana* on the table" vs "There is *banana* in this bread" - in the first, banana means the object, while in the second it means the substance

## Semantic relations between sentences

**Truth conditions** are the conditions required for a sentence to be true (and possibly meaningful?)

E.g. "Alex saw Fido" has truth conditions:

- There must be an individual named Alex
- There must be an individual named Fido
- Alex saw Fido 

Sentences that have the same meaning are called **paraphrases**. In this case, they have the same truth conditions.

E.g. "Fido was seen by Alex" is a paraphrase of "Alex saw Fido"

**Entailments** are a type of implication of sentences

E.g. "Prince is a dog" entails "Prince is an animal"

Sentence A entails sentence B if:

- whenever A is true, B is true
- the information that B conveys is contained in the information that A contains
- A and not B is never true (equivalent to first condition)
