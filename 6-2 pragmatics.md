# Pragmatics

The meaning of a sentence goes beyond the meaning of the individual words and their combinations. We also need to consider the speaker's intentions.

Pragmatics is the field that investigates how we go from the **conventionalized meanings** (literal meanings) of words and sentences to their **intended meanings**.

## Conversational maxims

### The Cooperative Principle

Being cooperative is making the appropriate contributions to keep the discussion going

### Grician maxims

These are rules proposed by Grice for how to satisfy the cooperative principle

- Maxim of Relation/Relevance: Be relevant
- Maxim of Quality: Do not say false things
- Maxim of Quantity: Do not include too much/too little information
- Maxim of Manner: avoid abiguity and obscurity, be brief and orderly

## Presuppositions

A **presupposition** is an assumption required to understand the meaning of a sentence.

E.g. "John returned to Cambridge" presupposes that John has been to Cambridge before

**Presupposition triggers** are expressions/structures that are sources of presuppositions (though not all presuppositions come from presupposition triggers).

- definite descriptions
- factive verbs
- change of state verbs
- iteratives
- counterfactuals

Note that presuppositions do not change when a statement is negated. This idea can help us validate presuppositions.
