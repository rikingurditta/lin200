# Factors Impacting Language Variation

## Geographic location

**Phonetic and phonological variation**

An example of pronunciation difference across location is *Canadian raising*, which exists in Canadian English as well as in some other places. This is when the first part of the diphthong [aj] is pronounced higher, as [ÊŒ]

**Lexicon**

There are words used in North America which are used differently or not at all in other places. For example, North Americans say "gas" and "truck" when British people say "petrol" and "lorry".

**Morphological and syntactic variation**

While in standard English, we express the recent perfect tense in sentences like "I've just eaten", speakers of many dialects would say "I done ate", and Newfoundland English speakers might say "I'm after eating".

## Time

All languages change over time, but not abruptly.

For example, "whale" and "wail" used to be pronounced differently, but over time they have progressively changed to the same pronunciation.

## Ethnicity

### African American English

- not spoken by all African Americans
- not spoken by only African Americans
- has been mistaken for grammatical errors by speakers of other dialects
