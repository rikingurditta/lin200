# Grammatical Patterns and Constituency Tests

## Constituency tests

A **syntactic constituent** is...

There are 5 common tests to check if something is a syntactic constituent:

1. Interposition
2. Replacement
3. Movement
4. Cleft
5. Answer to questions

### 1. Interposition

Constituents cannot have things placed between them.

e.g. in "Jordan saw them", we can insert "often" to make the phrase "Jordan often saw them", but we cannot insert it between "saw" and "them", i.e. "Jordan saw often them". Thus, "saw them" is a constituent (verb phrase)

### 2. Replacement

Constituents can be replaced by other words.

e.g. in "The students saw their friends", we can replace "their friends" with "them" to get "The students saw them"n

### 3. Movement

Constituents can often be moved to different parts of a sentence

### 4. Cleft

A cleft sentence has the form "it was ___ that ..."

### 5. Answer to questions

We can turn grammatical sentences into grammatical questions and answers if we do not split constituents.
