# What is a language?

How do we characterize a language?

## Languages in the world

- there are 4000-6000 in the world
  - we don't know the exact number because
    - it is difficult to distinguish dialects from languages
    - there are few/no comparative descriptions for most languages
- most of the population of the world speaks a few languages
- many languages are spoken by fewer than 10000 people

### Example: Canada

- Canada is multilingual:
  - English and French are official languages
    - Canadian English and American English are dialects
      - speakers of different dialects can understand each other - mutual intelligibility
      - speakers of different languages cannot understand each other
  - more than 70 indigenous languages
    - 12 language families
    - one family is Inuit language family, spoken in North of Canada, Alaska, Greenland
    - 37715 speakers
    - Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official lanugages (along with English and French) in Nunavut
  - immigrants speak other languages

## Synchronic and diachronic studies

A **synchronic** description is a description of a language at a particular point in time.

A **diachronic** description is a study of how a language changed over time.

### Example: Change in English language

| Period               | Time         |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Old English          | 500-1050     |
| Middle English       | 1050-1450    |
| Early Modern English | 1450-1700    |
| Present Day English  | 1700-present |

- many factors associated with language change - social, political, cultural, linguistic
- changes are gradual, but linguists classified periods based on particular common features
  - e.g. middle english differs from present day english in word order and vowel pronunciation
- languages are not static, they should be seen as dynamic

## Descriptive vs prescriptive grammar

**Descriptive grammar** is the set of unconscious rules that allow us to produce and understand a language

- main focus of linguistics research is describing how languages work

**Prescriptive grammar** is the set of rules that prescribe what we should say, according to some authority.

- writing conventions, spelling, punctuation

| Sentence                          |  Descriptive  | Prescriptive |
| :-------------------------------- | :-----------: | :----------: |
| I didn't know anyone at the party |  Grammatical  |   Correct    |
| I didn't know no one at the party |  Grammatical  |  Incorrect   |
| *No didn't one I at the party     | Ungrammatical |  Incorrect   |

- asterisk * denotes ungrammatical sentence
