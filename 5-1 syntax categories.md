# Syntax Categories

**Syntax** is the study of how words can be combined to form larger structures, i.e. phrases and sentences.

## Syntactic categories

We can group words into **word classes** based on

- morphological behaviour, i.e. the morphemes associated with the classes
- syntactic distribution, i.e. where the words occur in sentences

### Examples

Morphological behaviour:

- (count) nouns in English can be pluralized by adding "s" to the end
- verbs in English are marked for tense

Syntactic distribution:

- nouns in English can occur after articles (e.g. "a", "they")
- in Yawanawa, verbs usually appear at the ends of sentences

### Multiple categories

How do we classify words that seem to belong to more than one category?
